# Running tests

Execute one of the test_*.sh files on the command line. This will use your default
GCP credentials and will create buckets and objects during the course of the run.
These will be cleaned up with best effort however there is some possibility that
artifacts will remain. These are real operations as well, so any applicable
charges will be incured.

TODO(engeg@): Fill out this readme, automate running of tests, expand tests.
